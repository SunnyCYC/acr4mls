## Abstract


## Usage
In this repo we include one recording from the ASAP dataset [1, 2] as an example to demonstrate the usage of the proposed ACR method. Users may run [acr_usage.py](https://github.com/SunnyCYC/acr4mls/blob/main/acr_usage.py) directly to see how to generate both the visualization and quantitative results of ACR for the estimated beats and corresponding ground-truth beats.
